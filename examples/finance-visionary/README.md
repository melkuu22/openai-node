# AI & Finance Visionary: Sentiment Engine

> **"Bridging complex AI models with practical financial profit."**

This example demonstrates how to use the OpenAI Node.js SDK to build a foundational **Sentiment Analysis Engine**. This is the first step in creating a self-sustaining financial structure, as outlined in the "AI & Finance Visionary" methodology.

## Project Structure

*   **`sentiment_engine.ts`**: The core script. It acts as a prototype for an "Internal Algorithmic Fund".
    *   **Proprietary Data Sourcing**: Mocks the ingestion of raw financial news.
    *   **Hybrid Architecture**: Uses `gpt-4o` as a semantic reasoning engine to extract entities, sentiment, and risk profiles.
    *   **Structured Output**: Forces the AI to return strict JSON, enabling downstream algorithmic trading systems to act on the data without human intervention.

## Setup & Usage

1.  **Install Dependencies** (if you haven't already):
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2.  **Set your API Key**:
    The script uses the standard `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable.
    ```bash
    export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-sk-..."
    ```

3.  **Run the Engine**:
    We use `ts-node` (or similar) to run the TypeScript file directly.
    ```bash
    npx ts-node examples/finance-visionary/sentiment_engine.ts
    ```

## Methodology Explained

### 1. Iterative Model Refinement
In a production environment, this script wouldn't just run once. The `Action Signal` (BUY/SELL) generated by the model would be compared against the actual asset price movement 1 hour, 1 day, and 1 week later. This feedback loop would be used to "re-calibrate" the system prompts and confidence thresholds.

### 2. Risk-Adjusted Deployment
Notice the `risk_assessment` field in the code. A "Visionary" system doesn't just chase high sentiment scores. A score of `0.9` (Very Bullish) might be ignored if the `risk_assessment` is `CRITICAL` (e.g., due to regulatory uncertainty). This ensures the fund survives market volatility.

## Disclaimer

**Educational Use Only.** This code is a demonstration of software architecture using OpenAI's API. It is not financial advice. Real-world financial modeling requires rigorous backtesting, compliance checks, and risk management systems far beyond the scope of this example.
